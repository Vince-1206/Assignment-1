# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Song List 1.0

Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: _Lin, Han-Wei_

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
`songs.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
`songs_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used... it is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it
again.

Edit this README file, replacing the instructions (including this paragraph) with your own assignment details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace
the `answer...` parts).

1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

   > I have spent almost 10 days for assignment 1. For the first 3 days, I have try to focus on the option and list. 
I am try to complete to basis code. Next 5 days, I try to run and the fix the bug. Now the next 2 days, I will try to do 
make the code better. 

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

   >  For the assignment 2, I will plan to ask for help. Because during assignment 1, I take 
so long to understand about how to fix the bugs and connect with GitHub. Also, I will turn in the assignment earlier.
